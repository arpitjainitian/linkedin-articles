# 61. What Makes an AI an "Agent"? | AI agent

![Cover](images/061-ai-agent-cover.png)

*Explain It Like Hello World series: AI agent*

"AI agents" are the buzzword of the moment. Every product is suddenly an agent. What actually makes something an agent?

## The hello world

A chatbot is like a librarian: you ask, it answers, done. An agent is like a personal assistant: you say "book me a meeting with Priya next week", and it checks calendars, picks a slot, sends the invite and tells you when it's done.

That's the hello world: an **AI agent** takes a goal, decides the steps itself, uses tools to act, and keeps going until the job is done.

## One step further

Under the hood, it's a loop: the AI thinks about the next step, calls a tool (write-up 63), reads the result, and decides again, until the goal is met or it gets stuck.

That freedom is the power and the risk: an agent can take wrong steps, loop, or act on bad information. What goes wrong in practice is the theme of my Series 2, "Beyond Just RAG: From Answers to Actions".

## Where you've already met it

Coding assistants that edit files and run tests. Assistants that book, order or file things for you.

## The real name

An **AI agent**.

- **Agent:** an AI that plans steps and acts with tools to reach a goal.
- **Tool:** something the agent can use: search, calendar, database.
- **Agent loop:** think, act, check, repeat.

## What it's not

An agent isn't just a chatbot with a new name, and it doesn't need to be autonomous for everything. Many tasks are better as a fixed workflow.

## Take this to your next meeting

1. Ask: does this task need the AI to choose its own steps?
2. Give agents only the tools they need.
3. Put a person in charge of irreversible actions.

A chatbot answers. An agent gets it done.
