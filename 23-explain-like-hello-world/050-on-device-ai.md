# 50. What Is On-Device AI, and Can an AI Live on Your Phone? | On-device AI

*Explain It Like Hello World series: On-device AI*

"On-device AI." "Works offline." Phone makers now promise AI that never leaves your phone. How?

## The hello world

Asking a question to the cloud is like phoning a friend in another city: it needs a connection, takes a moment, and your question travels.

That's the hello world: **on-device AI** runs the model on your phone or laptop itself, so it works offline, answers instantly and your data can stay with you.

## One step further

It's made possible by small models (write-up 49), quantization (write-up 41) and NPU chips (write-up 48) in modern devices.

Because devices are limited, many features are hybrid: easy tasks run on the device, harder ones are sent to the cloud. Good products tell you which is which.

## Where you've already met it

Offline voice typing, photo clean-up, notification summaries and live captions that work in aeroplane mode.

## The real name

**On-device AI**, also **edge AI** or **local AI**.

- **On-device:** running on your own device.
- **Edge AI:** AI running close to where data is created.
- **Hybrid AI:** device for easy tasks, cloud for hard ones.

## What it's not

On-device doesn't always mean private. Check whether a feature quietly sends harder requests to the cloud.

## Take this to your next meeting

1. Use on-device AI for quick, private, everyday tasks.
2. Check which features stay on the device.
3. Expect hybrid: device first, cloud when needed.

No call to another city needed.
